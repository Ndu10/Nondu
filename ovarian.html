    <h1 class="heading"> What is Ovarian Cancer?</h1>
	
	<h2> Overview </h2>
	<p>Ovarian cancer is a growth of cells that forms in the ovaries.
  <br> The cells multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.</p>
  
  <p>The female reproductive system contains two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus.
  <br>The ovaries — each about the size of an almond — produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone.</p>
  
  <p>Ovarian cancer treatment usually involves surgery and chemotherapy.</p>
  
  
<h2> How it happens? </h2>
<p>
 <br>A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do.</p>
 
<p>Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. 
  <br>The mutations tell the cells to grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die.
  <br>The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor). Cancer cells invade nearby tissues
  <br>and can break off from a tumor to spread (metastasize) elsewhere in the body.</p>
  
  <h2> What causes  </h2>
<p>It's not clear what causes ovarian cancer, though doctors have identified things that can increase the risk of the disease.

Doctors know that ovarian cancer begins when cells in or near the ovaries develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions
that tell the cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to grow and multiply quickly, creating a mass (tumor) of cancer cells. The cancer cells continue living when
healthy cells would die. They can invade nearby tissues and break off from an initial tumor to spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body..</p>

<h2>Types of ovarian cancer</h2>

 <p>The type of cell where the cancer begins determines the type of ovarian cancer you have and helps your doctor determine which treatments are best for you. Ovarian cancer types include:</p>
 <ul class="a">
  <li>Epithelial ovarian cancer. This type is the most common. It includes several subtypes, including serous carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma.</li>
  <li>Stromal tumors. These rare tumors are usually diagnosed at an earlier stage than other ovarian cancers.</li>
  <li>Germ cell tumors. These rare ovarian cancers tend to occur at a younger age</li>
  
</ul>
 

<h2>Risk factors</h2>


<p>Factors that can increase your risk of ovarian cancer include:</p>

<ul class="b">
  <p><li>Older age. The risk of ovarian cancer increases as you age. It's most often diagnosed in older adults</p></li>
  
  <p><li>Inherited gene changes. A small percentage of ovarian cancers are caused by genes changes you inherit from your parents. The genes that increase the risk of  <br> 
  ovarian cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2. These genes also increase the risk of breast cancer.</p>  </li>
  
  <p><li>Family history of ovarian cancer. If you have blood relatives who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have an increased risk of the disease.</p> </li>
  
  <p><li>Being overweight or obese. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of ovarian cancer.</p>  </li>
  
  <p><li>Age when menstruation started and ended. Beginning menstruation at an early age or starting menopause at a later age, or both, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer.</p></li>

</ul>

Diagnostic tests are used when a person has symptoms. The purpose of diagnostic tests is to find out, or diagnose, what is causing the symptoms. Diagnostic tests also may be used to check a person who is considered at high risk for cancer.</p>
